Toh nimbu kitna pratishat hai?

**kitna nimbu hai** = 50 ml - 40 ml = 10 ml

**nimbu ki pratishat** = ( nimbu paani mei kitna nimbu hai ) / ( **paani aur nimbu milakar total kitna nimbu paani hai** ) * 100

Percentage is a very important concept in Maths.
To understand, please observe the following example carefully:

If there is a 50 ml Lemon water in a glass
Out of which 40 ml is water
And the remaining solution is the lemon.

Then what is the percentage of lemon?

Quantity of lemon = 50 ml - 40 ml = 10 ml

**% of Lemon**= ( Quantity of lemon in lemon water )/( **Total Quantity of lemon water including lemon and water** )*100

So, in the above example
    % of lemon = (10 / 50) * 100 = 20%

Keeping in mind above, now solve the following questions.
