Percentage bahut hi important concept hai maths mei. Bas aap yeh socho ki

Agar 50 ladke hai, aur
40 ladke healthy hai.
Aur baaki bache hue ladke bimaar hai.

Toh kitne pratishat ladke bimaar hai?

kitne ladke bimmar hai = 50  - 40 = 10

**bimmar ladko ki pratishat** = (kitne ladke bimaar hai)/(**total kitne ladke hai chahe healthy ho ya bimaar**)*100`

yaani,

```
bimaar ladko ki pratishat = (10 / 50) * 100 = 20%
```
Ab iss concept ko use karte hue, yeh questions solve karne ki koshish karna. Dhyaan rakhna - ki hamesha yeh sochna kitne healthy boys hai, kitne unhealthy aur kitne **total boys** hai?

Percentage is a very important question in Maths. To understand, please observe the following example carefully:

If there are 50 boys, out of which 40 are healthy.
And the remaining boys are unhealthy.

Then what is the percentage of unhealthy boys?

Number of unhealthy boys = 50 - 40 = 10

**% of unhealthy boys** = (number of unhealthy boys)/(**total boys healthy or unhealthy**)*100

So, in the above example

```
% of unhealthy boys = (10 / 50) * 100 = 20%
```
Now using this concept, please solve the following questions. Please take care to think carefully what is the number of unhealthy boys, healthy boys and **total boys**.
